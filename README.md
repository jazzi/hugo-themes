# Hugo Layout

This is a layout, rather than a full blown theme, for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).  I elected not to make this a theme in order to focus on just the bits in which I am interested, rather than try to make this extensible for other users.

It should still be informative to others, though, as I'm not trying to do anything particularly fancy.
