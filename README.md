# Hugo Themes

This is a collection of [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) themes that I've cobbled together.  Most are variations of plain HTML presentation of data with no CSS or styling.  See [plaintext](https://skippy.net/plaintext/) for my motivations.

These are not glamorous or novel. I'm not trying to do anything particularly fancy, but maybe these will be informative to other Hugo users.
